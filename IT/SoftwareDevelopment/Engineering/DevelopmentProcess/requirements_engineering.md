## **Domain Focus**

Every activity during the requirement engineering process focuses **only** on the requirements within the domain and uses the domain language.  
There are no specifications for any part of the implementation.  

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Tasks**
<br>

### **1. Extract the requirements**

By reading the customer specification and by talking to domain experts, users and other stakeholders we:

- get an overview and understanding of the domain
- collect interaction scenarios between the users and the system
- extract use cases from these interactions
- reconcile extracted use cases with users and domain experts

<br>
<br>

### **2. Negotiate the requirements**

We negotiate the prioritization and scope of the extracted requirements with the stakeholders.

<br>
<br>

### **3. Specify the requirements**

We specify the extracted and negotiated requirements in the required documents. These documents will later act as the basis for the development and the acceptance tests.

<br>

### **4. Validate the specification**

We make sure that the requirement specification is complete and correct.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Goal: Requirement Specification**
<br>

The requirement specification bundles all requirements and should answer the following questions:

1. What problem should the system solve?
2. What functions should the system offer?

<br>

The requirement specification should contain the following documents:

|Document                                       |Mandatory          |

## **Create A Use Case Diagram**
<br>
<br>

### **1. Collect And Describe Scenarios**

We start by collecting and describing interaction scenarios between concrete users and the system.  

The description of a scenario has to contain the following information:  

1. scenario name
2. short summary
3. involved persons
4. action flow 

<br>

**Example:**

**Scenario** Order - All products in stock  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee takes the order via telephone.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checks the address, banking information and credit rating of the customer.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he inserts the order details (ordered products and quantity) into the system.  
**end** Order - All products in stock

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **2. Model Actors**

We group all users from the scenarios and model them with actors.  
Other systems that our system may interact with are also modeled with an actor.

<br>

> **Attention:** Every modeled actor requires at least one corresponding entity in the real world.

<br>

![Actor Model](./pictures/requirements_engineering/requirements_engineering_actor_model.svg)

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **3. Model Use Cases And Connect Them With Actors**

We extract general use cases from the scenarios and collect them in a [use case diagram](../Modeling/UML/behavioralDiagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.md) and/or in a [textual specification](../Modeling/UML/behavioralDiagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.md#textual-specification) with pre- and postconditions.  

<br>

> Every modeled use case has to describe a well defined task that the system executes for a specified actor.

<br>

> **Attention:** Describe the use cases with domain terms, **not** with technical terms.

<br>

> **Attention:** A use case describes the usage of a system, **not** its implementation! 

<br>

> **Attention:** Be critical of use cases without any related actor!

<br>

> **Attention:** A complex use case can be split into multiple sub use cases!

<br>

![Use Case Model](./pictures/requirements_engineering/requirements_engineering_use_case_model.svg)

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **4. Model Dependencies Between Use Cases**

We search for dependencies like [include](../Modeling/UML/behavioralDiagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.md#include), [extend](../Modeling/UML/behavioralDiagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.md#extend) or [generalization](../Modeling/UML/behavioralDiagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.md#generalization-1) between the use cases and add them to our model. We can also group use cases into packages.

<br>

> **Attention:** Relationships between use cases should be modeled late in the process and should not be overused!

<br>

> **Attention:** Relationships represent a static split of functionality, **not** some kind of flow!

<br>

> **Attention:** Relationships between packages should be kept to a minimum!

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Create A Domain Class Diagram**
<br>
<br>

### **1. Identify Objects And Classes**

We identify relevant domain objects and classes.

<br>

> **Attention:** Every domain object or class requires at least one corresponding entity in the real world!

<br>

> **Attention:** Domain classes should have multiple instances in the real world!

<br>

> **Attention:** Every modeled domain class needs to be referenced in at least one use case or scenario!

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **2. Model Public Attributes And Relationships**

We add public attributes to the identified domain classes and model the relationships between these classes.

<br>

> **Attention:** We only model public attributes, **no** internal private attributes and **no** operations!

<br>

> **Attention:** Domain classes should have more than one attribute!

<br>

> **Attention:** Make sure to mark derived attributes and relationships as derived!

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **3. Check Model For Redundant Elements**

We check the model for redundant or incomplete elements.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **4. Model Generalizations**

We check the classes for similarities of attributes and relationships and generalize similar classes by moving the similar attributes or relationships higher up the generalization hierarchy.

<br>

> **Attention:** The correct and simple representation of the real world domain is more important than sophisticated generalization hierarchies!

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **5. Model Packages**

We can group the domain classes into packages to enhance the cohesion.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **6. Create Textual Specification**

Based on the domain class diagram we create a brief [textual specification](../Modeling/UML/structuralDiagrams/uml_class_diagram.md#textual-specification) of the classes in the language of the domain.  
We describe attributes and associations between classes in more detail.
