## **Basic Concept**
<br>

![EventQueue](domEventQueue.png)

<br>

* Event-emmitters are causing events
* Events are stored in a queue (FIFO)
* Event-loop checks queue for new events and forwards them to the event-handlers
* Event-Handlers are functions in javascript

<br>
<br>

Event Flow:

<br>

![EventFlow](./domEventFlow.png)

<br>

**1. Capturing Phase**
   - Event travels from root node of the dom tree towards the element for which it was triggered
   - Executes Event handlers specified for this phase at every node in its way

<br>

**2. Target Phase**
   - Event is handled at the target element

<br>

**3. Bubbling Phase**
   - Event travels from the element for which it was triggered towards the root node of the dom tree
   - Executes Event handlers specified for this phase at every node in its way

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Ways To Create Event-Handlers**
<br>
<br>

### **HTML-Event-Handler**
<br>

* Define handler in HTML attribute
* _DO NOT USE! KEEP HTML AND JAVASCRIPT SEPARATED!_

<br>

```html
<button onclick='handleClickEvent()'>Click</button>
```

```javascript
function handleClickEvent() { /* implementation */ }
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **DOM-Event-Handler**
<br>

* Define handler for element at dom level
* Can register ONLY ONE handler for each event
  * Multiple handlers for the same event at the same element are not possible

<br>

```javascript
function handleClickEvent() { /* implementation */ }

element.onclick = handleClickEvent;
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **DOM-Event-Listener**
<br>

* Define handler for element at dom level
* Can register MULTIPLE handlers for each event and element
* _RECOMMENDED WAY TO REGISTER EVENT HANDLERS_

<br>

```javascript
element.addEventListener('eventName', functionName, [options])
element.addEventListener('eventName', functionName, [useCaptureFlag])


options = {
    capture: true,              // event will be dispatched to listener before any elements beneath (default: false)
    once: true,                 // listener will be called at most once and is removed afterwards (default: false)
    passive: true,              // listener will not call preventDefault() and if so the call is ignored (default: false)
    signal: abortSignalObject
}


// Example:

element.addEventListener('change', function(event) { console.log(event.target.value) });
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Remove Event Handlers**
<br>
<br>

### **removeEventListener()**
<br>

* removes event listener registered by _addEventListener()_
* NOTE: If event listener is registered _both_ as capturing and non-capturing, it must be removed as _both_ capturing and non-capturing!

<br>

```javascript
element.removeEventListener('eventName', functionName, [options])
element.removeEventListener('eventName', functionName, [useCaptureFlag])


options = { capture: true}      // event will be dispatched to listener before any elements beneath (default: false)
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Initiate Events Via JavaScript**
<br>
<br>

### **Create Events**
<br>
<br>

#### **Event**
<br>

```javascript
let event = new Event('eventName', [options])


options = {
    bubbles: true,          // indicates whether event bubbles up the dom tree (default: false)
    cancelable: true,       // indicates whether event can be canceled (default: false)
    composed: true          // indicates whether event will propagate across the shadow dom (default: false)
};
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### **CustomEvent**
<br>

* customEvent can have additional custom information in detail object for an event handler

<br>

```javascript
let customEvent = new CustomEvent('eventName', [options])


options = {
    bubbles: true,
    cancelable: true,
    composed: true,
    detail: {property1: 'value1',
             property2, 'value2'}
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### **Dispatch Elements**
<br>

```javascript
element.dispatchEvent(event)
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Event Flow Interruption**
<br>
<br>

### **stopPropagation()**
<br>

* use method within an event handler/listener
* prevents event from getting passed on to the next node
* all other event listener for the event on the same node get executed regardless whether one listener envokes stopPropagation()

<br>
<br>

### **stopImmediatePropagation()**
<br>

* use method within an event handler/listener
* prevents event from getting passed on to the next node
* prevents event from getting handled by any other event listener of the same node

<br>
<br>

### **preventDefault()**
<br>

* preventDefault()
* works only for event-listeners
* suppress default action of the browser for event

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Event Types**
<br>
<br>

### **Event**
<br>

* Super type of all other event types
