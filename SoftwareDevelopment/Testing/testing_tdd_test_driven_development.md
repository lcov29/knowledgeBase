## **Basics**
<br>

- TDD is a design process that focuses on writing the tests first 
- follows the `Red - Green - Refactor` iteration:

<br>

|Phase    |Description 
|:--------|:-----------
|Red      |write test for a **small** functionality you want to add to your codebase
|Green    |implement the functionality so that the test passes
|Refactor |improve your written code and make sure the test still passes

<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Advantages**
<br>

- errors are easy to locate since we are working in small steps
- design decisions are constantly made and immediately tested

<br>
<br>
<br>

## **Process**
<br>

- start by testing the simplest test and incrementally add complexity
