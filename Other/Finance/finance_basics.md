## **Investment Factors**
<br>

There are three essential factors of every form of investment.

They stand in conflict with each other, meaning that the higher two factors are prioritized the lower the prioritization of the other factor gets.

**Example:** The more secure and liquid an investment is, the lesser its profitability will be.
